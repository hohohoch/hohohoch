a = 'ÐºÐ°Ð¼ÐµÐ½ÑŒ'
b = 'Ð½Ð¾Ð¶Ð½Ð¸Ñ†Ñ‹'
c = 'Ð±ÑƒÐ¼Ð°Ð³Ð°'

print('Ð²Ñ‹Ð±ÐµÑ€Ð¸')
print(a,'(1)')
print(b,'(2)')
print(c,'(3)')
ver = 0
while (ver == 0):
        player = int(input(" "))
        if (player == 1 or player == 2 or player == 3):
            ver = 1
if player == 1:
        print("Ð’Ñ‹ Ð²Ñ‹Ð±Ñ€Ð°Ð»Ð¸ ÐºÐ°Ð¼ÐµÐ½ÑŒ.")
if player == 2:
        print("Ð’Ñ‹ Ð²Ñ‹Ð±Ñ€Ð°Ð»Ð¸ Ð½Ð¾Ð¶Ð½Ð¸Ñ†Ñ‹.")
if player == 3:

spisok = ['paper','scissors','stone']

print(random.choice(spisok))
if spisok[0] and player == 1:
    win = 1
if spisok[0] and player == 2:
    win = 0
if spisok[0] and player == 3:
    win = 3
if spisok[1] and player == 1:
    win = 0
if spisok[1] and player == 2:
    win = 3
if spisok[1] and player == 3:
    win = 1
if spisok[2] and player == 3:
    win = 0
if spisok[2] and player == 2:
    win = 1
if spisok[2] and player == 1:
    win = 3

if win == 0:
        print("Draw!")
if win == 1:
        print("win player!")
if win == 2:
        print("win PC!")
